The main purpose of using Git is to make working on the code easier for eveyone. And also make it easier
for everyone to keep a track.

And we'll be using seperate header files to keep everything properly organised.
1. For the macros.
2. For the global variables.
3. For helper functions. e.g. function to ouput data to a matlab file.
4. For classes. i.e. for Host, Vector, Environment and any other if necessary.
5. And finally one for all the simulation drivers.

All this because header files will drastically reduce the time spent scrolling looking for a function 
or a variable. Also try to make commits with proper tags/messages to help keep a track and go back if
something goes wrong.
